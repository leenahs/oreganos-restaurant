# oreganos-restaurant
A group project done for a Web programming course.

Oregano's is a hypothetical italian restaurant that we conjured up to create its own website. It has pages for story, menu, gallery, location, and contact page.

As this is considered as the first web development project, we built the website without integrating a framework or using a library.

Special thanks to my two group members for working with me together on the Web programming project. Thank you so much!
